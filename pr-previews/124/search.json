    "text": "Have you used Turing.jl?\nGiven that you’re reading this, we hope so! We’re currently putting together a list of papers and other outputs (e.g. tutorials, presentations, …) which make use of Turing.jl. We’d love to have more examples, if you have any, please do get in touch (feel free to message me and I can forward it). Thank you!\nState of the AD\nOver the last few weeks we’ve been putting together a little project that tabulates the performance of different AD backends on a variety of Turing.jl models, and we’re now quite excited to share it: https://turinglang.org/ADTests/ This will hopefully help to answer the perennial question of whether you should stick with good old ForwardDiff, or whether you should try something else. Do note that (as of the time of writing) this table is still in alpha stage and there are a lot of details that have yet to be ironed out :slightly_smiling_face: However, suggestions are always welcome!\nJuliaBUGS.jl\nThe BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) language provides a declarative way to specify complex Bayesian statistical models. For years, implementations like WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and JAGS have been widely used tools for researchers applying these models. JuliaBUGS.jl is a modern implementation of the BUGS language, aiming for full backwards compatibility with standard BUGS models, while also offering improved interoperability with the Julia ecosystem. (For details and examples of BUGS syntax, check out the JuliaBUGS documentation.)\nA recent experimental update introduces significant performance improvements in JuliaBUGS: instead of relying solely on the previous graph-based approach, JuliaBUGS can now directly generate Julia code to compute the model’s log-density. This code generation technique can yield &gt;10x speedups compared to the graph-based method. Currently, this provides the most benefit for models with linear or hierarchical structures; support for state space models is planned for a future update.\nTo use it, run this after compiling your model:\nJuliaBUGS.set_evaluation_mode(your_model, JuliaBUGS.UseGeneratedLogDensityFunction())\nWe would love for you to test out this new functionality! If you have any feedback, please do feel free to open a GitHub issue or discussion.\nEven more advanced HMC\nLastly, we have a paper of our own to share on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods!\n\nXu, K., & Ge, H. (2024). Practical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on Riemannian Manifolds via Relativity Theory. Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Et8Pk97u4u and https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/34558\n\nWe will be looking to integrate these methods into Turing.jl in the future.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "DynamicPPL benchmarking\nDynamicPPL.jl now has a set of benchmarks that are run on GitHub Actions! We measure how long it takes to evaluate a small selection of models and also to run AD on them. If you think that there are specific models / features that we should add to the benchmarks, please feel free to create an issue and let us know.\nSeparately, we are planning to merge the benchmarking utilities in TuringBenchmarking.jl into DynamicPPL itself. There might be a little bit of API shake-up as part of this, but it’s for the better as it’ll allow the benchmarking code to more easily stay in sync with DynamicPPL — allowing us to catch performance regressions in PRs.\nSSMProblems\nThe SSMProblems.jl and GeneralisedFilters.jl packages have now been merged into a single repository: https://github.com/TuringLang/SSMProblems.jl. This won’t affect you if you are using the packages from the Julia General registry, but if you’re looking to develop off the main branch you may have to use a different URL, or specify a subdirectory in Pkg.add.\nSmaller bits\nOther code changes that have been merged:\n\nSome old code in AdvancedHMC.jl has been cleaned up quite a bit. See the 0.7.0 release for more information.\nTuring’s Gibbs sampler now supports warmup steps properly. We’re still thinking about how to properly encode the scenario where different sub-samplers have different numbers of warmup steps, if you have any ideas, do get in touch on that PR.\nWe are going to formally remove support for Zygote as an AD backend. We don’t test it thoroughly in Turing’s test suite. You can of course still use Zygote yourself, simply load ADTypes.AutoZygote() — although we can’t guarantee that we will fix any bugs that arise.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "DynamicPPL 0.36\nA new minor version of DynamicPPL brings with it a few changes especially to the behaviour of submodels. These have not yet percolated up to Turing.jl, but will soon be. Firstly, prefixing behaviour is changed: consider these models\n@model function inner()\n    x ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function outer()\n    a = [0.0]\n    a[1] ~ to_submodel(inner())\nend\nIf you ran this model, you would find that the single random variable was called a[1].x — but this isn’t the x field of the 1st element of a, it’s actually a variable whose name is literally just Symbol(\"a[1].x\"). DynamicPPL changes this behaviour such that the variable is correctly recognised as the x field of the 1st element of a. This means that if you are trying to, for example, condition on the variable, you can do:\nouter() | (@varname(a[1].x) =&gt; 1.0)\nOn the topic of conditioning, you can now also correctly condition or fix variables in a model before using it as a submodel, as this example demonstrates:\n@model function inner()\n    x ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function outer()\n    a ~ to_submodel(inner() | (@varname(x) =&gt; 1))\nend\nPreviously, if you wanted to do this, you would have to condition on @varname(a.x), meaning that you’d need to know the prefix before conditioning it. The current system allows for more modular construction of nested models.\nFor more complete details, please see the release notes.\nTuringBenchmarking.jl\nDynamicPPL 0.36 also brings new functionality that can be used for testing and benchmarking automatic differentiation on Turing models. This is what powers the ADTests table, which we shared last time round. (Psst — there are more examples now than before!)\nFor more information, see the docstring of DynamicPPL.TestUtils.AD.run_ad in the DynamicPPL docs.\nAs a corollary of this, the AD benchmarking functionalities in TuringBenchmarking.jl are not really needed anymore. If you are using this package, we recommend that you switch over to use the functionality that’s directly built into DynamicPPL.\nAdvancedHMC compatibility with ComponentArrays\nAdvancedHMC had a fairly long-standing issue where it couldn’t always be used with ComponentArrays as the position / momentum. This has now been fixed; you can take a look at the test suite to see examples of how they can be used together.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We (the Turing.jl team) are starting a fortnightly series of updates on what we’ve been up to and what’s in the works. We hope that this will provide you (our users) with some insight into the direction of the Turing ecosystem, and we’d also love for you to chip in with your thoughts if you have any.\nYou can keep up with the newsletter either on this website, on the #turing channel in Julia Slack, or by subscribing to our issue on GitHub. We might post to other places too (like Discourse), this is still in the works!\nNew Turing behaviour, especially .~\nRecently we have been focused on reworking a number of internal data structures in DynamicPPL.jl (this is the package that allows you to define models). We haven’t released this yet but you might be interested to see the changelog on GitHub. The main user-facing changes here are the simplification of broadcasted tilde .~ , which we previously posted about on Slack here. We also fixed a bug where the prefixes of nested submodels were applied in the wrong order.\nDifferentiationInterface migration\nFrom a developer perspective, we have now fully switched over to DifferentiationInterface.jl for automatic differentiation of models occurs. This work of course couldn’t have been possible without Guillaume Dalle’s work on DI itself and also his help with integrating it into DynamicPPL. This also paves the way for a long-standing goal of Turing, which is to expose a series of AD testing utilities that will allow AD package developers to test against a fixed set of models — this will allow us to formalise the idea of Turing being ‘compatible’ with a given AD package.\nThe plan for submodels\nWe have been discussing for a while now about how best to fully implement submodels (i.e. be able to treat submodels like distributions in the sense that we can sample from them, and also condition models on values obtained from submodels). There is currently a proposal which we’ve written up on GitHub, and goes into more depth about what we’d like to see and the underlying syntax. If this is a Turing feature that you use, do feel free to let us know what you think.\nTuring.jl is now published (again!)\nWe recently published a new paper with a high-level overview of Turing.jl’s features and implementation.

Below is a list of projects the Turing team would be interested in working with students on for the summer.\nIf you are interested in exploring any of these projects, please reach out to the listed project mentors. You can find their contact information at turinglang.org/team.\n\nMCMCChains improvements\nMentors: Cameron Pfiffer, Hong Ge\nProject difficulty: Easy\nDescription: MCMCChains is a key component of the Turing.jl ecosystem. It is the package that determines how to analyze and store MCMC samples provided by packages like Turing. It’s also used outside of Turing.\nFor this project, a student might improve the performance of the various statistical functions provided by MCMCChains, changing the back end to use a data storage format that maintains the shape of parameter samples, or improve the general plotting functionality of the package.\nThere’s lots of fun little things to do for MCMCChains. Check out this meta-issue for more details and discussions.\n\n\nParticle filtering methods\nMentors: Hong Ge, Cameron Pfiffer\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: Turing’s support for particle sampling methods is slowing being improved with the addition of AdvancedPS.jl. If you’re interested in implementing or improving particle sampling methods, this is a great project for you!\n\n\nNested Sampling\nMentors: Miles Lucas, Cameron Pfiffer, Hong Ge\nProject difficulty: Hard\nDescription: NestedSamplers.jl is an excellent package which implements nested sampling methods. As of yet, it is not connected to Turing.jl. For this project, a student would connect the NestedSamplers.jl library to Turing.jl.\n\n\nGPU acceleration\nMentors: Mohamed Tarek, Hong Ge, Kai Xu, Tor Fjelde\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: Turing’s native GPU support is limited in that the Metropolis-Hastings and HMC samplers do not implement GPU sampling methods. This can and should be done – GPU methods are awesome! If you are interested with working on parallelism and GPUs, this project is for you.\nStudents will work with the code at AdvancedMH or AdvancedHMC, depending on their interests.\n\n\nDocumentation and tutorial improvements\nMentors: Cameron Pfiffer, Martin Trapp\nProject difficulty: Easy\nDescription: Turing’s documentation and tutorials need a bit of an overhaul. Turing has changed significantly since the last time the documentation was written, and it’s beginning to show. Students would use their knowledge of probabilistic programming languages and Turing to shore-up or rewrite documentation and tutorials.\n\n\nIterative Methods for Inference in Gaussian Processes\nMentors: Will Tebbutt, S. T. John, Theo Galy-Fajou\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: There has recently been quite a bit of work on inference methods for GPs that use iterative methods rather than the Cholesky factorisation. They look quite promising, but no one has implemented any of these within the Julia GP ecosystem yet, but they should fit nicely within the AbstractGPs framework. If you’re interested in improving the GP ecosystem in Julia, this project might be for you!\n\n\nImplement advanced variational Gaussian process models\nMentors: ST John, Will Tebbutt, Theo Galy-Fajou\nProject difficulty: Easy to Medium\nDescription: Sparse variational Gaussian process models provide the flexibility to scale to large datasets, handle arbitrary (non-conjugate) likelihoods, and to be used as building blocks for composite models such as deep GPs. This project is about making such models more readily available within the Julia GP ecosystem - depending on your interests you can focus on making it easier for end users and providing good tutorials, or on the implementations of these models to give us the same or better performance as with established Python packages such as GPflow, integrating with Flux.jl, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It also cleans up the list of exported identifiers, and most notably, if you were using things from DynamicPPL, you will now also need to import DynamicPPL (or using).\nMore generally, it’s likely that from now on our releases will involve larger changes because we are aggregating more changes into a single minor version. We are, however, also committed to providing thorough release notes that will help users and library authors upgrade more easily! Release notes will be available on GitHub, and you can see the notes for Turing 0.37 and DynamicPPL 0.35 here. If you have any trouble upgrading, just drop us a note.\nAD backend testing\nRight now we test a series of DynamicPPL models with several AD backends. It’s rather ad-hoc and we are currently drafting a more formal interface for testing AD backends with Turing models. It’s still early days but if you are an AD package developer and want to know what this means for integration with Turing, get in touch (easiest way: ping Penny on Slack) 🙂\nUnified interface for optimisation algorithms\nThere’s an ongoing discussion about unifying the interface for MAP/MLE point estimates and variational inference (and potentially even MCMC). If you use more than one of these methods and have thoughts on what you’d like from an interface, we’d be very happy to hear from you!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Last year, Turing participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) through the Julia language organization. It was a fun time, and the project was better for it. Turing plans to participate in the upcoming GSoC, and we wanted to outline some potential projects and expectations we have for applicants.\nIf you are not aware, Google provides funds to students around the world to develop a project of their choice over the summer. Students receive funds from Google and spend three months on any open source project.\nThe Turing development team has prepared a list of possible projects that we have deemed valuable to the project and easy enough that it could feasibly be created in the three-month limit. This list is not exclusive – if you have a good idea, you can write it up in your proposal, though it is recommend that you reach out to any of the Turing team on Julia’s Slack (you can get an invite here) or Discourse. Messages on Discourse should be posted to the “Probabilistic programming” category – we’ll find you!\nPossible project ideas:\n\nBenchmarking. Turing’s performance has been sporadically benchmarked against various other probabilistic programming languages (e.g. Turing, Stan, PyMC3, TensorFlow Prob), but a systemic approach to studying where Turing excels and where it falls short would be useful. A GSoC student would implement identical models in many PPLs and build tools to benchmark all PPLs against one another.\nNested sampling integration. Turing focuses on modularity in inference methods, and the development team would like to see more inference methods, particularly the popular nested sampling method. A Julia package (NestedSamplers.jl) but it is not hooked up to Turing and does not currently have a stable API. A GSoC student would either integrate that package or construct their own nested sampling method and build it into Turing.\nAutomated function memoization by model annotation. Function memoization is a way to reduce costly function evaluation by caching the output when the same inputs are given. Turing’s Gibbs sampler often ends up rerunning expensive functions multiple times, and it would be a significant performance improvement to allow Turing’s model compiler to automatically memoize functions where appropriate. A student working on this project would become intimately familiar with Turing’s model compiler and build in various automated improvements.\nMaking Distributions GPU compatible. Julia’s GPU tooling is generally quite good, but currently Turing is not able to reliably use GPUs while sampling because Distributions.jl is not GPU compatible. A student on this project would work with the Turing developers and the Distributions developers to allow the use of GPU parallelism where possible in Turing.\nStatic distributions. Small, fixed-size vectors and matrices are fairly common in Turing models. This means that sampling in Turing can probably benefit from using statically sized vectors and matrices from StaticArrays.jl instead of the dynamic normal Julia arrays. Beside the often superior performance of small static vectors and matrices, static arrays are also automatically compatible with the GPU stack in Julia. Currently, the main obstacle to using StaticArrays.jl is that distributions in Distributions.jl are not compatible with StaticArrays. A GSoC student would adapt the multivariate and matrix-variate distributions as well as the univariate distribution with vector parameters in Distributions.jl to make a spin-off package called StaticDistributions.jl. The student would then benchmark StaticDistributions.jl against Distributions.jl and showcase an example of using StaticDistributions.jl together with CuArrays.jl and/or CUDAnative.jl for GPU-acceleration.\nGPnet extensions. One of Turing’s satellite packages, GPnet, is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of Gaussian process tools. See this issue for potential tasks – there’s a lot of interesting stuff going on with GPs, and this task in particular may have some creative freedom to it.\nBetter chains and model diagnostics. One package that Turing (and many others) rely on heavily is MCMCChains.jl, a package designed to format, store, and analyze parameter samples generated during MCMC inference. MCMCChains is currently showing its age a little and has many bad design choices that need to be fixed. Alternatively, a student could construct a far more lightweight chain system.\nModel comparison tools. Turing and its satellite packages do not currently provide a comprehensive suite of model comparison tools, a critical tool for the applied statistician. A student who worked on this project would implement various model comparison tools like LOO and WAIC, among others.\nMLE/MAP tools. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates can currently only be done by users through a clunky set of workarounds. A streamlined function like mle(model) or map(model) would be very useful for many of Turing’s users who want to see what the MLE or MAP estimates look like, and it may be valuable to allow for functionality that allows MCMC sampling to begin from the MLE or MAP estimates. Students working on this project will work with optimization packages such as Optim.jl to make MLE and MAP estimation straightforward for Turing models.\nParticle sampler improvements. Turing’s development team has spent a lot of time and energy to make inference methods more modular, but Turing’s particle samplers have not yet been modernized and spun off into a separate package. Two packages that resulted from this were AdvancedHMC for Hamiltonian MCMC methods, and AdvancedMH for Metropolis-Hastings style inference methods. A student who worked on this project would become very familiar with Turing’s inference backend and with particle sampling methods. This is a good project for people who love making things efficient and easily extendable.\n\nOther projects are welcome, but we do strongly recommend discussing any potential projects with members of the Turing team, as they will end up mentoring GSoC students for the duration of the project.\nWe’re looking forward to what people are interested in!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Turing.jl team is currently exploring possibilities in an attempt to help with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 crisis. As preparation for this and to get our feet wet, we decided to perform a replication study of the Imperial Report 13, which attempts to estimate the real number of infections and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19. In the report, the inference was performed using the probabilistic programming language (PPL) Stan. We have explicated their model and inference in Turing.jl, a Julia-based PPL. We believe the results and analysis of our study are relevant for the public, and for other researchers who are actively working on epidemiological models. To that end, our implementation and results are available here.\nIn summary, we replicated the Imperial COVID-19 model using Turing.jl. Subsequently, we compared the inference results between Turing and Stan, and our comparison indicates that results are reproducible with two different implementations. In particular, we performed 4 sets of simulations using the Imperial COVID-19 model. The resulting estimates of the expected real number of cases, in contrast to the recorded number of cases, the reproduction number \\(R_t\\), and the expected number of deaths as a function of time and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for each Simulation are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (a): hypothetical Simulation from the model without data (prior predictive) or non-pharmaceutical interventions. Under the prior assumptions of the Imperial Covid-19 model, there is a very wide range of epidemic progressions with expected cases from almost 0 to 100% of the population over time. The black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation. Note that \\(R_t\\) has a different time-range than the other plots; following the original report, this shows the 100 days following the country-specific epidemic_start which is defined to be 31 days prior to the first date of 10 cumulative deaths, while the other plots show the last 60 days.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (b): future Simulation with non-pharmaceutical interventions kept in place (posterior predictive). After incorporating the observed infection data, we can see a substantially more refined range of epidemic progression. The reproduction rate estimate lies in the range of 3.5-5.6 before any intervention is introduced. The dotted lines correspond to observations, and the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (c): future Simulation with non-pharmaceutical interventions removed. Now we see the hypothetical scenarios after incorporating infection data, but with non-pharmaceutical interventions removed. This plot looks similar to Simulation (a), but with a more rapid progression of the pandemic since the estimated reproduction rate is bigger than the prior assumptions. The dotted lines correspond to observations, and the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (d): future Simulation with when lockdown is lifted two weeks before the last observation (predictive posterior). As a result there is a clear, rapid rebound of the reproduction rate. Comparing with Simulation (b) we do not observe an immediate increase in the number of expected cases and deaths upon lifting lockdown, but there is a significant difference in the number of cases and deaths in the last few days in the plot: Simulation (d) results in both greater number of cases and deaths, as expected. This demonstrates how the effects of lifting an intervention might not become apparent in the measurable variables, e.g. deaths, until several weeks later. The dotted lines correspond to observations, the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation, and the red bar indicates when lockdown was lifted.\nOverall, Simulation (a) shows the prior modelling assumptions, and how these prior assumptions determine the predicted number of cases, etc. before seeing any data. Simulation (b) predicts the trend of the number of cases, etc. using estimated parameters and by keeping all the non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. Simulation (c) shows the estimate in the case where none of the intervention measures are ever put in place. Simulation (d) shows the estimates in the case when the lockdown was lifted two weeks prior to the last observation while keeping all the other non-pharmaceutical interventions in place.\nWe want to emphasise that we do not provide additional analysis of the Imperial model yet, nor are we aiming to make any claims about the validity or the implications of the model. Instead we refer to Imperial Report 13 for more details and analysis. The purpose of this post is solely to add validation to the inference performed in the paper by obtaining the same results using a different probabilistic programming language (PPL) and by exploring whether or not Turing.jl can be useful for researchers working on these problems.\nFor our next steps, we’re looking at collaboration with other researchers and further developments of this and similar models. There are some immediate directions to explore:\n\nIncorporation of more sources of data, e.g. national mobility, seasonal changes and behavior changes in individuals.\nHow the assumptions incorporated into the priors and their parameters change resulting posterior.\nThe current model does not directly include recovery as a possibility and assumes that if a person has been infected once then he/she will be infectious until death. Number of recovered cases suffers from the same issues as the number of cases: it cannot be directly observed. But we can also deal with it in a similar manner as is done with number of cases and incorporate this into the model for a potential improvement. This will result in a plethora of different models from which we can select the most realistic one using different model comparison techniques, e.g. leave-one-out cross-validation (loo-cv).\n\nSuch model refinement can be potentially valuable given the high impact of this pandemic and the uncertainty and debates in the potential outcomes.\nAcknowledgement We would like to thank the Julia community for creating such an excellent platform for scientific computing, and for the continuous feedback that we have received. We also thank researchers from Computational and Biological Laboratory at Cambridge University for their feedback on an early version of the post. \n\n\n\n Back to top"

Fjelde, Hong Ge\nProject difficulty: Medium\nProject length: 175 hrs or 350 hrs\nDescription: There are many real-world Bayesian models out there, and they deserve a Turing / Julia implementation.\nExamples include but not limited to - Forecasting (Prophet, datasets) - Recommender system (probabilistic matrix factorisation, dataset) - Ranking (TrueSkill, dataset) - Bayesian revenue estimation (example) - Political forecasting model (example) - Topic mining (latent Dirichlet allocation and new variants) - Multiple Annotators/Combining Unreliable Observations (Dawid and Skene, 1979)\nFor each model, we would consider the following tasks as part of a GSoC project: - Correctness test: correctness of the implementation can be tested by doing inference for prior samples, for which we know the ground truth latent variables. - Performance benchmark: this includes (i) time per MCMC step and (ii) time per effective sample; if the model is differentiable, a further break-down of (i) into (i.1) time per forward pass and (i.2) time per gradient pass are needed. - Real-world results: if available, the final step is to apply the model to a real-world dataset; if such an experiment has been done in the literature, consistency of inference results needs to be checked"

The representation should consist of the model and node representations (stochastic and deterministic, perhaps hyperparameters) and conform to the AbstractPPL model interface, with basic functions (evaluation of density, sampling, conditioning; at later stages some static analysis like extraction of Markov blankets). The model should also contain the state of the variables and implement the AbstractPPL trace interface (dictionary functions, querying of variable names). The result should be able to work with existing sampling packages through the abstract interfaces."

From there, support for a wider range of the functionality available in KernelFunctions.jl and AbstractGPs.jl can be added.
