All good open source projects should have a blog, and Turing is one such project. Later on, members of the Turing team may be populating this feed with posts on topics like

- Interesting things you can do with Turing, or interesting things we have seen others do.
- Development updates and major release announcements.
- Research updates.
- Explorations of Turing's internals.
- Updates to Turing's satellite projects [AdvancedHMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedHMC.jl) or [Bijectors.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl).

Stay tuned!
