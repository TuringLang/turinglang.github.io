Turing v0.38 has just been released and incorporates the changes from DynamicPPL which were mentioned [in the last newsletter](/news/posts/2025-04-25-newsletter-5). It also contains a fix for the Gibbs sampler, so that you can now specify arbitrary VarNames for each sampler (previously, you could only specify single-symbol VarNames). For example, you can now specify the `a.x` and `b.x` VarNames here:

```julia
@model function inner()
    x ~ Normal()
end
@model function outer()
    a ~ to_submodel(inner())
    b ~ to_submodel(inner())
end
sample(outer(), Gibbs(@varname(a.x) => MH(), @varname(b.x) => MH()), 100)
```

It is theoretically possible that this will be slow for VarNames that involve indexing (e.g. `x[1]`), although we don't have an example of this yet. If you find anything you think should be faster, let us know.

One other minor point: [on ADTests](https://turinglang.org/ADTests/) you can now hover over a model name to see its definition.
